# Deep Learning Project

The present notebook deals with Named Entity Recognition (NER). The goal is to train three different neural network models on a labeled dataset to learn recognizing named entities. To begin with, the task of NER is about identifying named entities in a text. Named entities can include: names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, and others. Once a model recognizes a named entity as such, a corresponding label is assigned to the entity, e.g. "University of Konstanz" -> ORG (organization), "Konstanz" -> LOC (location). The next cell illustrates the task of Named Entity Recognition using the spacy library.
